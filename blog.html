          <h2> Corn: A versatile, nutritious choice </h2>
          <p> Corn is the second most plentiful cereal grown for human consumption, and many cultures around the world have lived on this grain. Corn is a versatile crop, and everything on a corn plant is useable. No part of the corn is wasted. The husk of the corn is traditionally used in making tamales. The kernels are ground into food. The stalks become animal food and the corn silks are used for medicinal teas. </p>
               <br>    
               <p>Food products made from corn include corn oil, corn meal, corn syrup and even bourbon. The most important refined corn products are corn sweeteners, which last year accounted for more than 56% of the national nutritive sweeteners market. One cup of raw white corn has about 130 calories, 2 grams of fat, 5 grams of protein, 29 grams of carbohydrates and 4 grams of fiber with no cholesterol. </p>
            <br>
            <p> These “everyday things” are made with corn: protective sealing bands, gypsum dry wall, warmish, spark plugs, adhesives, toothpaste, aspirin, diapers, coated paper products and more. Scientists continue to find more uses for corn including fuel-efficient tires, food and beverage containers, carpet tiles and candy wrappers. </p>
